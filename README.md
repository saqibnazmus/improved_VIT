# Improved Vision Transformer (ViT) for Image Classification

## Project Title
**"Enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) with Advanced Attention Mechanisms for Image Classification"**

## Project Overview
This project introduces an enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) model for image classification, incorporating multiple improvements to the attention mechanism, residual connections, learnable positional encodings, and hybrid attention strategies. The model aims to achieve higher accuracy and improved generalization for image classification tasks, particularly on large datasets such as ImageNet, Pascal VOC, and MSCOCO.

### Key Improvements:
- **Improved Attention Mechanism**: The model leverages an improved multi-head attention mechanism where the attention weights are adapted using a learnable scaling factor. This helps the model better focus on important features from different parts of the input image.
  
- **Residual Connections**: Each transformer block has residual connections, which add the input to the output after both the attention mechanism and the feed-forward layers. This facilitates the flow of gradients during training, making the model easier to optimize and improving performance.

- **Learnable Positional Encodings**: The model uses learnable positional encodings instead of fixed sinusoidal embeddings, which allows the transformer to learn position-specific representations for the image patches.

- **Multi-Layer Transformer**: The model consists of multiple stacked transformer blocks that capture complex dependencies across the patches of the image, improving its ability to understand global and local features.

- **Hybrid Attention**: While not explicitly implemented in this version, there is potential to experiment with hybrid attention mechanisms (local + global) to improve performance in capturing both fine-grained and large-scale patterns.

### Key Training Steps:
1. **Patch Embedding**: The input image is divided into smaller patches using a Conv2D layer. Each patch is then embedded into a vector of the same dimension.
   
2. **Positional Encoding**: Learnable positional encodings are added to the patch embeddings to help the model understand the spatial relationships between patches.

3. **Transformer Blocks**: The core of the model consists of multiple transformer blocks. Each block includes:
   - **Multi-head attention**: The attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on different parts of the image.
   - **Feed-forward Networks (FFN)**: These layers process the output from the attention mechanism.
   - **Residual Connections**: The input to each transformer block is added back to the output after both the attention mechanism and FFN, enabling efficient gradient flow.

4. **Classifier Head**: After processing through the transformer layers, the output is passed through a classification head that aggregates the information and produces the final class predictions.

### Training:
- **Optimization**: The model is trained using the **Adam optimizer** with a learning rate of 0.001.
- **Loss Function**: **CrossEntropyLoss** is used for multi-class classification.
- **Training Process**: The model undergoes standard training procedures with backpropagation. The training loop involves computing the loss, performing backpropagation, and updating the model's parameters using the optimizer.

- **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated on training and validation datasets, tracking accuracy over each epoch. The validation accuracy is used to select the best model.

## Conclusion:
The improved Vision Transformer (ViT) model offers significant performance gains for image classification tasks. Key improvements in the attention mechanism, residual connections, and learnable positional encodings enable the model to capture complex patterns in the input data, leading to enhanced accuracy and better generalization. The ability to experiment with hybrid attention mechanisms further opens avenues for improvement. This architecture has the potential to achieve state-of-the-art results on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet, Pascal VOC, and MSCOCO.
